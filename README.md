# STARWARS SWAPI TEST-PROJECT

The goal of this test task is to create a web application using the latest version of Next.js, Axios for API requests, and React Flow for visualizing information as a graph. The application allows users to browse a list of Star Wars heroes and view detailed information about each hero, including the films they appear in and the spaceships they have traveled on.
